        <p class="about_paragraph">“We push each other to be the best. It’s not
            uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs
            to be better, back to the drawing board’”
            - Bryan Teddy, lead vocalist of The Bees
            Knees</p>
        <h3>The Bees Knees</h3>
        <p>The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
            from San Francisco, California. The band
            consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
            Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
            Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
            band achieved its first commercial success as
            an unsigned act, drawing attention from
            manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
            other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
            One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
            confident the band could succeed even further,
            pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.</p>
        <p>From there, the band has soared, gaining
            international recognition and ranking in the
            top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
            immediately fell in love with the band’s original
            and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
            one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
            acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
            themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
            their candid and authentic performances on
            stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
            The Bees Knees are currently recording their
            second studio album, looking to be released in
            late 2021.</p>
